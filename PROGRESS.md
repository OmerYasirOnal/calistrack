# CalisTrack — Progress Log

Append-only. Newest at top. One entry per completed task/work session.

---

## 2026-06-02 — M8 T34 Branded splash [branch feat/calistrack-m8-t34-splash]
- **Task:** replace the bare cold-start spinner with a branded splash (audit major).
- **Added:** `_SplashScreen` (dumbbell logo + "CalisTrack" wordmark + "Master
  bodyweight strength" tagline + spinner) shown while the first auth state
  resolves; splash-gate test asserts the branding. 96 tests.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean.

## 2026-06-02 — M8 T33 Email verification [branch feat/calistrack-m8-t33-email-verification]
- **Task:** verify emails (audit major) — send on sign-up + let users resend.
- **Added:** `AuthRepository.sendEmailVerification` (Firebase impl guards on
  already-verified); `AuthController.registerWithEmail` now sends it best-effort
  after bootstrap (a failed verification email never fails registration);
  `AppUser.emailVerified` sourced from the auth identity (`mapFirebaseUser`),
  defaults true for profile-derived users; Profile shows a "Verify your email"
  card with a Resend button only when unverified.
- **Tests:** register sends verification; Profile resend (unverified) + no card
  when verified. 95 pass, 82.0%% coverage.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 95/95 pass.

## 2026-06-02 — M8 T32 "Forgot password?" [branch feat/calistrack-m8-t32-forgot-password]
- **Task:** remove the permanent-lockout landmine (audit major) — a password reset path.
- **Added:** `AuthRepository.sendPasswordResetEmail`; a "Forgot password?" link on
  the login screen opening a small reset dialog (email seeded from the login
  field, own send state so it doesn't entangle the sign-in controller) → success
  closes + "Reset link sent — check your inbox.", failure shows a retryable error.
  Fake + preview updated.
- **Tests:** tap → dialog → enter email → send → repo called with the email +
  confirmation shown. 91 pass, 80.6% coverage.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 91/91 pass.

## 2026-06-02 — M7 T31 AdService + banner + interstitial [branch feat/calistrack-m7-t31-adservice]
- **Task:** wire the chosen monetization (AdMob) safely.
- **Added:** `AdService` abstraction with a **conditional import** — web/desktop/
  tests get a `NoOpAdService`, mobile gets the `google_mobile_ads`-backed
  `MobileAdService` (so the web build never imports the ads SDK, which has no web
  support — verified `flutter build web -t lib/preview.dart` still compiles).
  `AdConfig` (test vs prod, android vs ios, from `ad_config.json`); a pure
  `shouldShowInterstitial(count, everyN)` cap; a banner on the Progress tab; an
  interstitial after a finished session (internal session counter, config-capped);
  `MobileAds.initialize()` at startup (guarded, no-op off-device); ATT/UMP left
  as a documented owner-TODO.
- **Safe in tests:** `MobileAdService.isSupported` is false on the non-mobile test
  VM, so every method no-ops without touching the SDK — widget tests need no
  override.
- **Tests:** cap logic, AdConfig selection (env/platform + default), NoOpAdService.
  90 pass, 80.5% coverage, web build green.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 90/90 pass.

## 2026-06-02 — M7 T30 android/ios platforms + google_mobile_ads + AdMob config [bundled into PR #26]
- **Task:** native platforms + AdMob dependency/config (foundation for T31).
- **Added:** `flutter create` android + ios (org com.calistrack); `google_mobile_ads`
  dependency; `assets/data/ad_config.json` (test sample units + owner-TODO prod ids
  + `interstitialEverySessions` pacing cap); AdMob App ID meta-data in
  AndroidManifest.xml + iOS Info.plist (Google sample/test ids, owner-TODO) + iOS
  NSUserTrackingUsageDescription. Removed the flutter-create template test.
- **Note:** a local branch mix-up landed commit `873a2bc` on the T29 branch, so it
  merged via **PR #26 alongside T29** (CI-green) rather than its own PR; its
  adversarial review is folded into T31's. Confirmed present in `main`.

## 2026-06-02 — M7 T29 Guidance polish [branch feat/calistrack-m7-t29-guidance]
- **Task:** funnel + educate at the empty/idle moments.
- **Added:** Progress empty-state CTA "Log your first workout" → Today; a
  context-aware Skills intro banner that auto-hides once any skill advances
  (no manual-dismiss state to persist); a Progress/skills nudge line on the
  session-complete summary.
- **Tests:** Progress CTA, Skills intro shown when no progress, session-summary
  nudge. 83 pass, 82.2% coverage.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 83/83 pass.

## 2026-06-02 — M7 T28 Exercise coaching content [branch feat/calistrack-m7-t28-coaching]
- **Task:** make movements coachable, not just named.
- **Added:** rewrote all 19 `exercises.json` descriptions from terse labels
  ("Horizontal push.") into genuine one-line form cues ("Hands under shoulders,
  body in one straight line — lower until elbows reach about 90°…"). New derived
  `exerciseCuesProvider` (id → cue). Cues now surface on the **learning** surfaces:
  the program-detail movement list (subtitle) and the onboarding **first-session
  primer** (under each movement). Confirmed names already resolve everywhere (no
  raw ids leak — the audit's claim was largely off).
- **Decision:** kept the **Today logger compact** (no cue clutter on the active-
  training card) — cues live on the inspect/learn surfaces. Avoids cluttering the
  log loop and the layout-fragile logger tests.
- **Tests:** program-detail cue assertion added; primer cue exercised by the flow
  test. 83 pass, 81.8% coverage.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 83/83 pass.

## 2026-06-02 — M7 T27 Onboarding: recommended program + primer (straight line to first set) [branch feat/calistrack-m7-t27-program-primer]
- **Task:** finish the onboarding spine — recommend a program and drop the user
  straight into their first session.
- **Added:** two more steps to `OnboardingScreen` (now Welcome → About You →
  **Your program** → **First session primer**). The program step reuses the
  existing `AiGenerationController` to generate from the captured answers (AI when
  reachable, deterministic local fallback otherwise) and previews it; "Start this
  program" saves + activates it. The primer shows Day 1 + a plain-language note,
  and **"Start training" starts the Day-1 workout session and completes
  onboarding** — so the gate lands the user on Today already mid-session, ready to
  log (the funnel "straight line", no behavior change to Today → existing tests
  stay green). Escape hatch: "Pick one myself" finishes onboarding without a
  program (empty Today guides to Programs).
- **Tests:** full-flow integration (Welcome → … → Today session, asserts answers
  + flag + active program persisted) with an injected deterministic caller; About
  You step tests refocused (Continue advances; selections survive Back). 81 pass,
  81.5% coverage.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 81/81 pass.
- **Deferred:** the *Programs-tab* set-active dead-end (audit's secondary funnel
  gap) → folded into T29 guidance polish, to avoid reworking programs_screen_test
  here.

## 2026-06-02 — M7 T26 Onboarding screens: Welcome + About You [branch feat/calistrack-m7-t26-about-you]
- **Task:** turn the minimal onboarding into a real multi-step flow that captures
  personalization.
- **Added:** `OnboardingAnswers` + `OnboardingAnswersController` (level/goals/
  daysPerWeek/equipment + optional body stats; goal/equipment options + day
  bounds as named constants, not literals); multi-step `OnboardingScreen`
  (progress header + shared Back/Continue footer + AnimatedSwitcher) with steps
  **Welcome** (value prop) and **About You** (SegmentedButton level, +/- days,
  goal/equipment FilterChips, collapsible optional height/weight). `complete()`
  now persists level/goals/heightCm/weightKg + the flag in **one** merge write
  (`completeOnboarding` extended). Body-stat setters reconstruct (not copyWith)
  so an emptied field clears to null.
- **Tests:** answers controller (toggle, clamp, clear-to-null); end-to-end
  Welcome → About You → pick level+goals → Finish persists to the profile and
  lands on Today; gate test updated to the 2-step nav. 79 pass, 80.9% coverage.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 79/79 pass.
- **Deferred to T27 (per review of T25):** the initial-location flash polish folds
  into the program/primer step rework.

## 2026-06-02 — M7 T25 Onboarding gate + state [branch feat/calistrack-m7-t25-onboarding-gate]
- **Task:** the spine of the first-run onboarding — a router gate + completion state.
- **Added:** `AppUser.onboardingCompletedAt` (DateTime?, ISO-8601 round-trip,
  Firebase-free); `UserRepository.completeOnboarding(uid, at)` (targeted merge);
  `OnboardingController.complete()` (stamps the flag, surfaces errors); a pure
  `authRedirect()` extracted from the router so the gate's branches are unit-
  testable; `/onboarding` route + a minimal Welcome `OnboardingScreen` (T26/T27
  expand it). Router now also watches `currentUserProfileProvider` so the gate
  keys off the profile, not just the auth identity.
- **Gate logic:** signed-out → /login; signed-in + profile flag null → /onboarding;
  flag set → kept out of auth+onboarding; profile not-yet-known → no forced
  redirect (no trap). Preview + test fixtures marked onboarded so existing
  full-app tests still land on Today (`onboardedUser()` helper).
- **Tests:** AppUser flag round-trip; 5 pure-gate branch cases; end-to-end
  new-user → onboarding → complete → Today. 76 tests pass, 80.7% coverage.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 76/76 pass.

## 2026-06-02 — 🎉 MVP CODE-COMPLETE (M1–M6 all merged to `main`)
- **Milestones:** M1 Foundation · M2 Auth · M3 Programs & Workout · M4 Progress &
  Skills · M5 AI generation (Cloud Function + fallback) · M6 Polish — all done,
  issues #1–#6 closed, PRs #7–#19 merged (merge commits, history preserved).
- **Quality bar:** CI green on `main` — format · analyze · 69 tests · **80.1%**
  line coverage (75% gate). Every task went through a fresh adversarial review.
- **Architecture:** feature-first (data/application/presentation), Riverpod,
  go_router shell, repository pattern, all balance/preset data in `assets/data/*`
  (no magic numbers), every async surface has loading/error/empty states.
- **AI safety constraint honored:** OpenAI is called **only** server-side from the
  `generateProgram` Cloud Function (auth-gated, key in a Firebase secret). The
  client never holds an API key; it falls back to a local preset when undeployed.
- **Owner-only steps remaining (cannot run from this session):**
  `flutterfire configure` (real Firebase config) · deploy the function
  (`firebase functions:secrets:set OPENAI_API_KEY` + `firebase deploy --only
  functions`) · iOS/Android release builds + Apple/Play signing.

## 2026-06-02 — M6 T24 CI coverage gate [branch feat/calistrack-m6-t24-coverage]
- **Task:** enforce test coverage in CI.
- **Added:** CI `ci.yml` now runs `flutter test --coverage` + a **line-coverage
  gate (≥ 75%)** that parses `coverage/lcov.info` and fails the build below the
  bar. `coverage/` gitignored.
- **Current coverage:** **80.1%** (1503/1876 lines) — comfortably above the gate.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 69/69 pass.

## 2026-06-02 — M6 T22+T23 Offline persistence + a11y polish [branch feat/calistrack-m6-t22-offline]
- **T22 Offline:** enable Firestore persistence explicitly in `main.dart`
  (`Settings(persistenceEnabled: true, cacheSizeBytes: CACHE_SIZE_UNLIMITED)`),
  set after `initializeApp` (only when Firebase is wired). Offline-first via the
  built-in cache; a Hive mirror would be redundant for Firestore data — decision
  documented in the M6 spec.
- **T23 a11y:** tooltips/semantics on the icon-only steppers (logger reps/kg/sec,
  skill +/-, AI days). States audited — every async surface already has
  loading/error/empty.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 69/69 pass.

## 2026-06-02 — M5 T21 AI generation screen + user programs [branch feat/calistrack-m5-t21-ai-screen]
- **Task:** the AI UI — form → generate → preview → save — and surface user
  programs in the Programs tab.
- **Added:** `programs/presentation/ai_generation_screen.dart` (level/days/goals/
  equipment form → Generate → preview w/ fallback banner → Save & set active),
  `AiGenerationController` (generate/save). Programs screen now has a "Generate"
  FAB (pushes the AI screen) + a "Your programs" section (userProgramsProvider).
  Preview extended with an in-memory user-program repo so save works without
  Firebase.
- **Tests:** AI form → generate (fake service) → preview → save persists +
  sets active. `save` now awaits auth (robust to an unresolved auth snapshot).
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 67/67 pass.

## 2026-06-02 — M5 T20 AI client service + persist + fallback [branch feat/calistrack-m5-t20-ai-client]
- **Task:** the client side of AI generation — call the function, parse, persist,
  and a fallback so it works without deploy.
- **Added:** `programs/application/ai_program_service.dart` — `GenerationRequest`,
  `AiProgramService.generate` (injectable Cloud Function caller; parses the
  response resolving movement names from the library + dropping unknown ids;
  `usedFallback` flag), pure `fallbackProgram` (preset matching daysPerWeek →
  Foundations, renamed). `programs/data/user_program_repository.dart`
  (`saveProgram` + `watch` `users/{uid}/programs`, `userProgramsProvider`).
  **activeProgramProvider now resolves presets + user programs.** Fakes added.
- **Tests:** fallback mapping (days-match / no-match), generate (valid parse +
  name resolve + unknown-id drop), error→fallback, empty-days→fallback. 65/65 pass.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 65/65 pass.

## 2026-06-02 — M5 T19 generateProgram Cloud Function [branch feat/calistrack-m5-t19-generate-function]
- **Task:** server-side AI program generation (OpenAI), deploy-ready.
- **Added:** `functions/` (TS) — `generateProgram` onCall: validates the request,
  prompts OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`) for strict-JSON, **sanitizes** the output
  server-side (only known exerciseIds, ≥1 day, sane sets) and returns a
  Program-shaped object. Key read from a Firebase **secret** `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  (never in client/repo). `functions/{package.json,tsconfig.json,README.md,
  .gitignore}` + root `firebase.json`. **Not deployed** (needs owner's Firebase
  + key — see functions/README.md); the client (T20) is fallback-first so the
  feature works meanwhile.
- **Verified:** Flutter package unaffected (analyze clean, smoke green); secret
  scan finds no committed key. (Node function not exercised by the Flutter CI.)

## 2026-06-02 — M4 T18 Skills screen [branch feat/calistrack-m4-t18-skills-screen]
- **Task:** browse skill progressions, log step attempts, advance the ladder.
- **Added:** `features/skills/presentation/skills_screen.dart` (list with
  completion bars + next step, replaces placeholder), `skill_detail_screen.dart`
  (step ladder done/current/locked, keyed per-step logger for reps/hold,
  mark-complete + step-back), `application/skill_providers.dart`
  (`SkillController` log/setStep). Router: nested `/skills/:skillId`. Preview
  extended with an in-memory `_PreviewSkills` (seeded Front Lever 25% / Pistol
  50%) so the tab renders without Firebase.
- **Tests:** list renders both skills; detail opens → logs an attempt
  (logCalls + saved logs) → advances the step (setStepCalls + index).
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 58/58 pass
  · Progress + Skills screenshotted from the preview.

## 2026-06-02 — M4 T17 Skill trees + SkillRepository [branch feat/calistrack-m4-t17-skills-repo]
- **Task:** preset skill progressions + a repo that merges them with saved progress.
- **Added:** `assets/data/skills.json` — 5 trees (Muscle-up / Front Lever /
  Planche / Handstand / Pistol Squat), each step with exactly one target
  (reps or hold). `features/skills/data/skill_repository.dart` — `SkillRepository`
  (presets from assets, `watch(uid)` merging saved `users/{uid}/skills` progress,
  `logAttempt` via arrayUnion, `setStep`), pure `mergeSkills()` overlay,
  `skillRepositoryProvider` + `userSkillsProvider`. `FakeSkillRepository` added.
- **Tests:** preset parse + integrity (5 skills, unique step ids, exactly-one-
  target per step, start at step 0), `mergeSkills` overlay.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 56/56 pass.

## 2026-06-02 — M4 T16 Progress screen + fl_chart [branch feat/calistrack-m4-t16-progress-screen]
- **Task:** turn aggregated history into a visual Progress tab.
- **Added:** `features/progress/presentation/progress_screen.dart` — overall
  stats card (streak / this-week / workouts / volume), a history-only exercise
  picker (ChoiceChips), and a **type-aware fl_chart line chart**
  (volume / best-hold / distance / sets) with empty + "<2 points" states.
  Replaces the placeholder (router unchanged — same class).
- **Preview:** `lib/preview.dart` seeded with 3 prior Push sessions so charts +
  the "last time" reference both render.
- **Tests:** empty state + chart renders (stats card, picker name, metric label,
  `LineChart`) for an exercise with history.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 50/50 pass.

## 2026-06-02 — M4 T15 Progress repository [branch feat/calistrack-m4-t15-progress-repo]
- **Task:** aggregate logged workouts into progress insight.
- **Added:** `features/progress/data/progress_repository.dart` — pure
  `exerciseHistory()` (chart-ready per-exercise series: reps/volume/top-weight/
  best-hold/distance, oldest→newest) + `overallStats()` (totals, this-week,
  consecutive-day streak ending today/yesterday). `ProgressRepository` wraps
  `WorkoutRepository.recent`; providers `overallStatsProvider`,
  `exercisesWithHistoryProvider`, `exerciseHistoryProvider.family`.
- **Tests:** pure aggregation (history ordering + aggregates, cardio distance),
  stats + streak edge cases (empty / today-yesterday / gap / stale), and the
  repo wired to a fake. M4 design spec committed.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 47/47 pass.

## 2026-06-01 — M3 T13+T14 Today + session engine + set logging [branch feat/calistrack-m3-t13-today-logging]
- **Task:** the core loop — pick a program day, log sets, finish to a summary.
- **Data:** `features/workout/data/workout_repository.dart` (save + recent +
  `lastSetsFor` for the "last time" reference), `training_defaults.dart` +
  `assets/data/training_defaults.json` (rest-by-type, no magic numbers).
- **Engine:** `features/workout/application/workout_session.dart` — immutable
  `WorkoutSession` (completion% + volume + `toWorkout`) and a **keepAlive**
  `WorkoutSessionController` (startDay/logSet/removeSet/finish→persist).
  `lastSetsForProvider` family. Reintroduced `activeProgramProvider` (now
  **awaits** the profile, fixing a flash-of-empty-state).
- **UI:** `today_screen.dart` (empty state → day-picker chips → live header
  (progress + volume) → finish), `widgets/exercise_logger_card.dart` (per-set
  steppers for reps/weight/hold/distance/duration, logged chips, last-time ref,
  post-set rest countdown), `session_summary.dart` (completion dialog).
- **Preview:** `lib/preview.dart` — fake-backed entrypoint
  (`flutter run -t lib/preview.dart`) that boots into a seeded Push session, so
  the authed UI is runnable/screenshottable without Firebase.
- **Tests:** session-engine logic (log/edit/finish/volume/completion/toWorkout)
  + Today widget flow (pick day → log → finish → summary) + empty state; smoke
  & splash tests updated for the real Today screen.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 35/35 pass
  · preview web build screenshotted (logging UX).

## 2026-06-01 — M3 T12 Programs screen [branch feat/calistrack-m3-t12-programs-screen]
- **Task:** browse presets, open a program's day/movement breakdown, set it active.
- **Added:** `programs/presentation/programs_screen.dart` (real list, replaces
  placeholder), `program_detail_screen.dart` (days + targets + set-active +
  active footer), `widgets/program_card.dart`, `program_format.dart`
  (`targetSummary` — reps/hold/distance/duration). State:
  `profile/application/profile_providers.dart` (`currentUserProfileProvider`),
  `programs/application/program_providers.dart` (`activeProgramProvider`,
  `ActiveProgramController.setActive`). `UserRepository.setActiveProgram` (merge
  write) + fake updated to a live broadcast stream. Router: nested
  `/programs/:programId` detail route.
- **Tests:** new widget test pumps the app → Programs → detail → Set as active →
  asserts persistence + active footer. Smoke test updated for the real screen.
- **Note:** in-app screens are auth-gated; live screenshots await Firebase config
  or a preview mode (planned for T13/T14).
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 27/27 pass.

## 2026-06-01 — M3 T11 Programs repo + presets [branch feat/calistrack-m3-t11-programs-repo]
- **Task:** preset programs + ProgramRepository, plus a backward-compatible
  cardio model extension so a Run day logs end-to-end.
- **Models:** `LoggedSet` += `distanceMeters?` / `durationSeconds?`;
  `ProgramExercise` += `targetDistanceMeters?` / `targetDurationSeconds?` (all
  nullable + conditional JSON → legacy docs still parse).
- **Added:** `assets/data/programs.json` — 4 presets (Classic PPL · PPL + Core ·
  Foundations · Hybrid w/ a Run day), storing ids + targets only with names
  resolved from the library. `features/programs/data/program_repository.dart`
  (`presets(library)` resolves names, throws on unknown ids) with
  `programRepositoryProvider` + `presetProgramsProvider`.
- **Tests:** model round-trip + legacy-parse for the new fields; ProgramRepository
  preset parse, **preset-integrity** (every exerciseId resolves in the library),
  cardio-target presence, and a `StateError` on an unknown id.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 26/26 pass.

## 2026-06-01 — M3 T10 Exercise library repo [branch feat/calistrack-m3-t10-exercise-repo]
- **Task:** ExerciseRepository — load the bundled movement library from assets.
- **Added:** `features/exercises/data/exercise_repository.dart` (injectable
  `AssetBundle`, in-memory cache, `all()` + `byId()`) with
  `exerciseRepositoryProvider` + `exerciseLibraryProvider`. Tests:
  `test/features/exercises/exercise_repository_test.dart` — real-asset load
  (19 unique, well-formed movements), `byId` hit/miss, cache identity, and an
  injected-fixture parse proving the loader is unit-testable.
- **Also:** corrected the design spec's library count (18 → 19).
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.38.9):** format clean · analyze clean · 18/18 pass.

## 2026-06-01 — M2 Auth (T6–T9) [branch feat/calistrack-m2-auth]
- **Task:** Firebase-backed auth — email + Google sign-in, gated routing,
  profile bootstrap.
- **Changed:** `core/providers/firebase_providers.dart`,
  `features/auth/data/auth_repository.dart` (+`authStateProvider`),
  `features/profile/data/user_repository.dart` (`ensureProfile` = T9),
  `features/auth/application/auth_controller.dart`,
  `features/auth/presentation/{login,register}_screen.dart` + `auth_form_fields`,
  `core/router/app_router.dart` → `goRouterProvider` w/ auth gate,
  `app.dart` → ConsumerWidget, `features/profile/presentation/profile_screen.dart`.
  Tests: `auth_controller_test`, `login_screen_test`, updated `app_smoke_test`,
  `test/support/fakes.dart`.
- **Process note:** code-signing only works from the main checkout, not linked
  worktrees — so milestones are developed in the main checkout on feature
  branches (worktree commit attempts fail signing). Lost the first worktree copy
  to a bad `worktree remove` and recreated it here.
- **Verified locally (Flutter 3.44.0):** format clean · analyze clean · 13/13 pass.

## 2026-06-01 — Local Flutter toolchain + verified-green M1
- Installed **Flutter 3.44.0 stable** in the session container (network policy
  allows storage.googleapis.com), ending blind CI iteration. All future
  milestones are now verified locally (`dart format`, `flutter analyze`,
  `flutter test`) before pushing.
- Ran the real gates on the branch and fixed the last issues definitively:
  - `flutter analyze` → removed `unnecessary_import` (foundation in main.dart)
    and `unused_import` (material in app_smoke_test) → **No issues found**.
  - `dart format` (3.44 "tall" style) reformatted `firebase_options.dart` and
    `exercise.dart` → **clean**.
  - `flutter test` → **8/8 passed**.
- M1 is functionally complete pending the CI mirror going green.

## 2026-06-01 — M1 review + CI fix
- **Review:** Fresh zero-context agent audited the M1 diff against the CI gates
  (`dart format`, `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`).
- **Findings & resolution:**
  - Two `dart format` wraps (`models_test.dart` SkillLog, `app_smoke_test.dart`
    for-loop) → pre-wrapped to match `dart format` output.
  - One `require_trailing_commas` lint (`models_test.dart` ProgramDay) → fixed.
  - Agent also flagged `Color.withValues`/`CardThemeData` as "3.22 blockers".
    **Overridden:** CI runs *latest stable* Flutter (≥3.27) where these are the
    correct, non-deprecated APIs; switching to `withOpacity`/`CardTheme` would
    fail analyze on deprecation infos. Instead bumped pubspec floor to
    flutter ≥3.27 / Dart ≥3.6 so the manifest matches the APIs used.
  - Removed unused codegen dev-deps (build_runner/riverpod_generator/
    hive_generator) + riverpod_annotation to avoid `analyzer` resolution
    conflicts on latest stable; they return when codegen is actually used.
- **Result:** Pending CI re-run on PR #64.

## 2026-06-01 — T1–T5 Foundation (M1)
- **Task:** Bootstrap the CalisTrack Flutter project (scaffold, theme, router, models, CI).
- **Changed:**
  - `calistrack/pubspec.yaml`, `analysis_options.yaml`, `.gitignore`
  - `lib/main.dart`, `lib/app.dart`
  - `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart` — Material 3 dark-first theme + tokens
  - `lib/core/router/app_router.dart` — go_router + bottom-nav shell
  - `lib/models/{app_user,program,workout,skill_progress,exercise}.dart` — JSON models
  - `lib/features/*/presentation/*_screen.dart` — five shell screens
  - `test/models/*_test.dart` — model round-trip tests
  - `.github/workflows/calistrack-ci.yml` — analyze + test gate
- **Result:** Scaffold compiles to a navigable 5-tab shell (pending CI confirmation — no local Flutter SDK in the build container, so `flutter analyze`/`test` run in CI).
- **Next:** M2 Auth (T6–T9).
